            <h2>What is a System?</h2>
            <p>A system is an arrangement where all its component assembles work according to the specific define rules. It is a method of organizing, working, or performing one or more tasks according to a fixed plan.</p>

            <h2>What is an Embedded System?</h2>
            <p>An embedded system is a combination of computer software and hardware which is either fixed in capability or programmable</p>

            <h2>History of Embedded system</h2>
            <p>Here, are important milestones from the history of embedded system:

            In 1960, embdded system was first used for developing Apollo Guidance System by Charles Stark Draper at <br>
            In 1965, Autonetics, developed the D-17B, the computer used in the Minuteman missile guidance system. <br>
            In 1968, the first embedded system for a vehicle was released. <br>
            Texas Instruments developed the first microcontroller in 1971. <br>
            In 1987, the first embedded OS, VxWorks, was released by Wind River. <br>
            Microsoft's Windows embedded CE in 1996. <br>
            By the late 1990s, the first embedded Linux system appeared. <br>
            The embedded market reach $140 billion in 2013. <br>
            Analysts are projecting an Embedded market larger than $40 billion by 2030.</p>

            <h2>What is Microcontroller?</h2>
            <p>A microcontroller is a single-chip VLSI unit which is also called microcomputer. It contains all the memory and I/O interfaces needed, whereas a general-purpose microprocessor needs additional chips to offered by these necessary functions. Microcontrollers are widely used in embedded systems for real-time control applications.</p>
                
            <h2>What is a Microprocessor?</h2>
            <p>A microprocessor is a single chip semiconductor device. Its CPU contains a program counter, an ALU a stack pointer, working register, a clock timing circuit. It also includes ROM and RAM, memory decoder, and many serial and parallel ports.</p>
